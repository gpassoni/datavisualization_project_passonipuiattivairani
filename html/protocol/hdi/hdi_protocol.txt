Metadata: 

Data Visualization process: The process was pretty straight forward. Imported the data using pandas, imputed the missing ones using kNN imputer.
Shaped the data frmae to meet our requirements (Country as columns and Years as rows). Plotted using plotly.express.

All actions performed:

-Importing libraries
-Imputing missing variables
-Singled out the columns of interest
-Singled out the years from the columns names
-Reshaped dataframe with countries as columns and years as indexes
-Changed data type of the interested feature into float because it was an integer
-Plotted the visualization
